## Engineering Experience

**Master Thesis** @ [Hensoldt Analytics](https://www.hensoldt-analytics.com/) _(Aug 2022 - Feb 2023)_ <br>
Motion extraction from videos captured by moving cameras:
  - Ego motion compensation due to camera movements, by panoramic scene building.
  - Motion extraction by low rank and sparse approximation, using Robust Principal Component Analysis.  
Training object detection model, to detect tiny object like drones:
  - Using different input data, RGB frame, RGB & Raw Motion, RGB & Binary Motion, and RGB & Trajectory map, shows that adding more informations enhance detector's perfomance for small object detection.
